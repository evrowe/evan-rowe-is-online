Today is my 40th birthday.

That feels like one of the most normal things I've said or written lately, at least until I think about how long a period of time 40 years is. Then it feels weird, but only a little.

I feel great "for my age;” if anything 40 is very different than I thought it would as a kid, or even an overly self-assured 20-something. Like, yeah, mid-life, or major milestone or whatever, but really it is kind of just another birthday, and I think I've been settling into the idea of being in my 40s for the past two to three years. Of course I'm 40; I practically have been for a while.

Previous life milestones felt way more consequential to me in terms of "aging" and the inevitable passage of time. I have the benefit of more perspective now but I realize, as so many have before me, that 40 is still pretty young, as far as adults go! That's really great, for me at least. It also doesn't hurt that much of my generation seems to be aging really well, at least comared to our barometer for what 40 should look like according to popular media of our childhood. But also maybe reality? Hard to say for sure, everything from 30 years ago is kind of hazy.

My body doesn’t recover from things as quickly as it used to; I started taking antidepressants a few years ago for pretty normal reasons; I have to actually pay attention to what I eat (thanks metabolism and genetics). I also still feel pretty strong and capable, even if it takes more work and dedication to see the kinds of results in my health as I did when I was younger. That’s fine, I have the patience for it now.

The main thing I've been thinking about for the past year or two leading up to this, is the importance of recognizing how much life there still is ahead and enjoying that life now while I still have my health and relative youth to take advantage of. The one thing I know I'll regret 40 more years from now is if I were to waste these next 10 or 20 years being hung up on getting older, and letting that get in the way of enjoying this really amazing phase I'm in.

A phase of self-actualization, and returning to myself as I was in younger days, but with more wisdom and an even keel. A phase of parenthood as a primary function of my identity, which by the way is hard as hell most days lately thanks to having three young kids, but is also so rewarding and fun and worth all of the stress it imparts upon me. A phase of reflection, growth, and confidence in myself I've been fighting to build and rebuild over a lot of life and career shifts. Imposter syndrome, I resolve to cast you off to the extent that you stop getting in the way of my ability to recognize my own accomplishments. What a bastard that is.

There's a lot I could say about things I've been up to lately; hobbies, interests, the doldrums, things that matter to me or things I've learned or whatever. Today is the one day each year I feel moderately comfortable centering myself in any conversation, but only to the extent that it's actually interesting to anybody reading it, and honestly if you're still here after all of the above, you're either a real one or you have very little else to do at the moment. You're probably on the toilet right now, aren't you? Hopefully this is more entertaining than the back of a shampoo bottle.

I'm glad to be here. 40 is great, for me at least, and I'm honestly doing as well as or better than I could have expected for myself at this point in life. I don't know what more I could ask for.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to haul this creaking, withered husk out of my chair so I can slam some Tylenol to aid my recovery from my morning bike ride, and will myself forward into the rest of my day of enjoyment and celebration, but not too much celebration, and a reasonable bed time. Ha HA! Age humor.
